A Helm Chart to deploy the greate [SysEleven Exporter](https://github.com/Staffbase/syseleven-exporter) in Kubernetes.

### Prometheus

If you want an [Prometheus ServiceMonitor](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator/blob/master/Documentation/api.md#servicemonitor) you can use the `prometheus.serviceMonitor.enabled` flag, which is false by default. The default `serviceMonitor.interval` is 10 minutes, since the API is only polled once per hour by the exporter pod.

```bash
prometheus.serviceMonitor.enabled
prometheus.serviceMonitor.interval 
```

The default Namespace for the ServiceMonitor is the Helm Release Namespace.
If you need the ServiceMonitor in an other namespace, you have to specify the `prometheus.serviceMonitor.namespace`.

```bash
prometheus.serviceMonitor.namespace
```

#### Rules

To use a default set of Prometheus Alertrules, you have to enable the `prometheus.rules.enabled` flag. Simliar to the ServiceMonitor, you can adjust the default Namespace with `prometheus.rules.namespace`.

To see the full list of all options look at [Values.yaml](charts/syseleven-exporter-chart/values.yaml).


#### Dashboard

To use a default Grafana Dashboard, you have to enable the `prometheus.dashboards.enabled` flag. Simliar to the Rules, you can adjust the Namespace with `prometheus.dashboards.namespace`.

To see the full list of all options look at [Values.yaml](charts/syseleven-exporter-chart/values.yaml).
